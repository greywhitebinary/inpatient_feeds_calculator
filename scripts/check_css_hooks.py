"""Every data-testid webapp/styles.css relies on still exists in Streamlit.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
webapp/styles.css reaches into Streamlit's internal DOM, and those
`data-testid` attributes carry no stability guarantee. The sibling project
BTF-Calc learned this the expensive way: Streamlit Community Cloud resolved
its loose requirement against whatever was newest at deploy time, landed on
1.60.0, and silently broke the tab-label CSS. That is why both repos now pin
streamlit exactly.

Nothing in a test suite catches this. The tests drive Streamlit's *Python*
API and never see a stylesheet, so a renamed test id breaks the page while
every test stays green. This script fills that hole: it reads the selectors
the stylesheet actually depends on and asserts each one still appears in the
frontend bundle Streamlit ships.

It earns its keep twice. Against the pinned Streamlit it guards the status
quo, which is nearly free. Against the *latest* Streamlit -- which is what
.github/workflows/canary.yml runs it under -- it answers the question the
pin otherwise makes expensive to ask: is the next upgrade safe to attempt?

TWO LIMITS, DELIBERATE
----------------------
1. This catches a test id that was RENAMED or REMOVED. It does not catch a
   restructured DOM where the id survives but its nesting, order or
   defaulted styles change, which would break a descendant or sibling
   selector just as thoroughly. This is the cheap majority of the
   protection, not all of it. A green run means the hooks exist, not that
   the page looks right -- only opening it does that.

2. It checks `data-testid` only, NOT `data-baseweb`. styles.css uses
   `data-baseweb="input"` and `data-baseweb="base-input"`; those strings are
   short enough to occur somewhere in a 20 MB bundle by coincidence, so
   checking them would report confidence it had not actually established.
   A false PASS is worse here than no check, because it is the one people
   trust and stop thinking about.

Keep this file in sync with its twin, BTF-Calc's scripts/check_css_hooks.py.
Only STYLESHEET differs.
